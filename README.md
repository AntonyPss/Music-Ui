2. In the **Phonk Music Ui** folder there will be another folder that will say `sounds`, with the file explorer, you will copy or move the audio file in the same folder named above.

## ðŸ’» Windows
1. The first thing you need to do is press the `Win` + `R` keys. This will open a menu that will give us the option to run programs.

2. In the text box, type the following:
`C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\resource_packs`. This will take you directly to the resource packs folder.

3. Using a converter, convert the audio file to `.ogg`, then find the `Phonk Music Ui/sounds/music/...` folder and copy the audio file to that location.
